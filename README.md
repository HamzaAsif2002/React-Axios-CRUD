Post Manager is a simple yet powerful React application that demonstrates full CRUD operations using Axios with a mock REST API (jsonplaceholder.typicode.com). The app allows users to:

Create new posts using a dynamic form

Read and display a list of posts

Update existing posts with pre-filled form editing

Delete posts instantly from the UI

This project showcases practical React patterns such as state management with useState, side effects with useEffect, and clean API integration using Axios. It also includes UI feedback like loading states and controlled form inputs, making it both functional and beginner-friendly.
